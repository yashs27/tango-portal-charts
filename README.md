# 5GTANGO Portal

## Dependencies

- Node.js >= v8.9

```
[sudo] sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

[sudo] npm install -g npm
```

- Angular >= v6

```
[sudo] npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Installation

Make sure that you have all the dependencies installed. Then, run the following command to install all the required modules.

```
npm install
```

## Running a dev server

If you just want to test the app, or start developing something you can quickly serve it with the following. This includes hot reloading for any (html/css/js) change.

```
ng serve --open
```

### Running dependencies

Requests made from the Portal in the development mode need the VPN in order to receive a response.

- Athens VPN credentials

## Running a docker container

If you want to launch a container locally, place yourself in the Dockerfile folder and try the following:

```
[sudo] docker build -t tng-portal .
[sudo] docker run -p 80:4200 tng-portal
```

The container should be up and running in http://0.0.0.0:80.

### Exposed port in docker container

The port where the app will run when using the Docker container can be set in `./Dockerfile`. By default, 4200 is set.

### Docker dependencies

Make sure you have installed Docker >= 18.06.0-ce

- [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

## Configuration parameters

The routes to the services for this project are defined in the config.service.ts file placed in `/src/app/shared/services/config/config.service.ts`.

By default, if the Portal is launched locally, the used services come from:

- For SP: `http://pre-int-sp-ath.5gtango.eu:32002`
- For V&V: `http://pre-int-vnv-bcn.5gtango.eu:32002`

### Menu sections displayed

Depending on the deployed modules in the infraestructure, the menu will display only those available. For that, there is a configuration variable called `features_available` in `/src/environments/environment.ts` and in `/src/environments/environment.prod.ts`.

These are the sections that can be activated:

```
  features_available:  [
    "DASHBOARD",
    "USERS",
    "CONFIGURATION",
    "VALIDATION",
    "SERVICE PLATFORM",
    "SERVICE MANAGEMENT"
  ]
```

To remove any of them from the menu just erase the desired item from the configuration variable and compile the project again.
